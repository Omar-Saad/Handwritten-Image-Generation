# Handwritten-Image-Generation
Handwritten numbers Image Generation using GANs.

The objective of this project is to generate handwritten images using Generative adversarial networks (GANs).
The model consists of two parts :\
1 - Discriminator : The Discriminator is like police man who tries to know whether a given image is fake or real.\
2 - Generator : The generator generate images of handwritten images and tries to fool the discrimnator by generating an image like a real one.
